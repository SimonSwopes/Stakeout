# Decentralized AI-Driven Cyber Threat Detection System

## Minimal Viable Product (MVP) Proposal
### MVP Design
**Threat Detection:** Malicious IP Addresses  
**Data Storage:** InterPlanetary File System  
**Detection Strategy:** Isolation Forests  
**UI:** Minimal Web-based visualization Dashboard  

### MVP Deliverables
1) Ingests network logs or synthetic security data
2) Detects malicious or anomalous behavior using machine learning
3) Stores and shares threat indicators on a decentralized platform
4) Ensures privacy and security with encryption for sensitive data
